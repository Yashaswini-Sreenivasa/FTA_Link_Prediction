**FTA lINK PREDICTION**

FTA Link Prediction is a project focused on predicting missing links in large Fault Trees or multiple Fault Trees using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). 
This repository includes scripts for generating fault tree datasets and implementing the GCN model for link prediction.

Repository Structure
main.py: Script to build and preprocess the dataset of fault trees according to specific requirements.
generator.py: Utility script used alongside main.py for generating fault tree structures.
GCN.py: Implementation of the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to predict missing links in the fault trees.
